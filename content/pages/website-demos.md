Though this portfolio is hosted directly on WordPress for the sake of
simplicity, you may want to explore some pages I have created to
demonstrate my experience with Office365, G Suite, Django, and cloud
hosting. My experience is mainly in back-end development, which does
involve some of my own HTML/CSS/JS for wireframing.

Cloud Hosting
=============

Amazon Web Services - A simple static site is currently hosted on AWS at
<http://capngown.org>. It is a placeholder while I work on the web app
intended for the domain and also serves to demo some basic
HTML/CSS/JavaScript front end develoment.

Google Cloud Platform - Periodically, I back up posts from this site on
[www.mutterberg.ml](http://www.mutterberg.ml/), a free domain name I
switched over to Google Cloud nameservers. I have a GCP compute engine
with a LAMP stack running Wordpress.

Google Sites
============

Google Sites has two forms: classic and new. My classic demo site is
[here](https://sites.google.com/a/utterbergdatadev.com/gsuitedemos/) and
my "new" demo site is
[here](https://sites.google.com/utterbergdatadev.com/gsuite-demos/).

Django
======

The website for Cleveland PyLadies is the most polished of my Django
projects publicly available, at the moment. However, I do have a
[publicly available demo
site](https://afternoon-anchorage-94697.herokuapp.com/catalog/) that
shows backend logic proficiency with a small library catalog app (with a
postgreSQL database) deployed on Heroku.

GitHub Pages
============

[My user gh-page](https://mutterberg.github.io) currently opens to
https://datadev.me and highlights work from my \#100DaysOfCode
challenge, undertaken to hold myself accountable for developing/posting
project repos in public. The site itself links to project gh-pages in a
variety of domains, including [a Pelican build automated on
Travis-CI](https://mutterberg.github.io/pelican-playground) and several
data science projects gh-pages.
