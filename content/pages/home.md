Welcome to my portfolio website. As the url suggests, my tech
specialties are Data Science and Web Development.

Though I am familiar with front-end basics, I prefer web projects that
involve back-end or full-stack development. My framework of choice is
Django, but I also have experience with WordPress, Flask, Pelican, and
myriad cloud platform tools.

What I most enjoy is exploring and analyzing data in a variety of
contexts: business, civics, research, etc. My professional passions in
research and technology are focused on asking well-formed questions,
collecting appropriate data to address issues, and making conclusions or
inferences with an open mind - rather than simply processing data in
ways that make it say what the user wants it to say. To this end, I have
also developed an interest in cloud computing and Data Engineering to
build, refine, and innovate quality ETL pipelines.

In addition to the selection of write-ups on this portfolio site, I have
several other sources for project information: [my
GitHub](https://www.github.com/mutterberg), [my \#100DaysOfCode project
site](https://mutterberg.github.io), and [the Cleveland PyLadies
site](https://clepyladies.github.io).

Take a look around and feel free to [contact
me](http://utterbergdatadev.com/contact/) if you're interested in
contracting a project or part-time consultation.
