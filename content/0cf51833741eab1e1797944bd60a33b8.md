I'm a community moderator/writer at Opensource.com and came upon your
work with data science, R, Python etc which is a very interesting field
to me personally. I also note that you have a M.Ed which is something I
also have as a former(retired) teacher. I wonder if you would consider
and interview/article about your work with R, Python and data science
and how that can be incorporated in PK-12 education.
