Duke University's course website for CompSci 290 from the Fall term of
2015 is still active. I have been using their [programming
assignments](https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall15/compsci290.1/project.html)
as a guide to practice the skills learned in MOOCs. One of the main
values in academia is the actual instruction, however I am grateful for
the direction these assignments afford this career changer.

The links from 2015 are no longer valid because the White House decided
to stop publishing visitor data in 2017, but archives of previously
released data are available at [the Obama White House
website](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/goodgovernment/tools/visitor-records),
which states that it is "frozen in time" as historical material. A csv
file was the main resource available, with [attribute descriptions still
available as
text](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/files/disclosures/visitors/WhiteHouse-WAVES-Key-1209.txt).
The data itself took a while to download because it was not compressed -
the file clocked in at 1.21 GB!
