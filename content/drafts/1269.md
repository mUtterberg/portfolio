Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) allows you to store objects in
buckets. Standard guarantee is for 99.9% availability.

The main charges are for storage and requests, but there is also storage
management pricing, data transfer pricing, and the option to purchase
transfer acceleration.

Caveat: depending on the health of AWS servers in a given region,
transfer acceleration may NOT always be faster than standard transfer.

As you can see in the above slide show, taken from [this Amazon S3 Speed
Comparison
result](http://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html?result=00201-9459-12247-22507&identityId=unknown),
Dublin, Frankfurt, & Seoul actually experienced faster test results from
direct upload than from the accelerated transfer. There are several
reasons we may encounter this, most of which are anomalous or temporary.

File transfer speed comparison between Amazon's S3, Glacier, CloudFront,
Elastic Load Balancer, and Google Cloud Storage.
