Here's a quick tip that should ease that little voice in your head
wondering if your users will be able to tell that SMS came from an
online service, an uncertainty only relevant to those with a trial
account on Twilio. You know that little preamble that says "Sent from
your Twilio trial account?"

Fret not, there's no such Twilio message once you switch to a fully
functional account. Upgrade away, my friends!
