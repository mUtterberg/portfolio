Oops!
=====

I managed to lock the @CLEPyLadies twitter account last week and am
still waiting on the humans to fix this. I'm also still wading my way
through html files, getting the website in a workable state. That hasn't
been my singular focus, so it's not ready to deploy.

HOWEVER...<!--more-->

Hoorays!
========

Our live [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/CLE-PyLadies/) is alive
and growing! As of last night, we were already up to 13 members. I put a
line in the welcome email asking new members what type of events they'd
like to attend and one person already responded saying she wants to
*learn* Python! So pumped.

Although I don't use my own Facebook, it has been fun putting together
the [Cleveland PyLadies Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/clepyladies/). It doesn't seem to have
the nice meetup and twitter feed integrations right off the bat, but I
also haven't invested as much time in it yet. At the very least, it
seems like a good place to reach out and find those not yet in a local
meetup community!

It also offered built-in integration for MailChimp, so I put together a
little intake form that gives users the option to tag their email with
their interests relative to the group and to Python as a whole. It's
also available on [this secure Google
Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeWsFel250TfBO-6NjjFuf-T4-_ct0rSOHpazRzcPBLLqoFQ/viewform?usp=sf_link),
which I manually batch-import for now.
