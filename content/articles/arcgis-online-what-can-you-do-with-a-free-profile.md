It turns out ArcGIS (a GIS package for Python) is \$100 a year just for
personal use - even for the Online Viewer subscription. Hard pass,
thankyouverymuch. You can make a free profile to use their Online map
creation service, however you are limited to available layers or must
use their paid (or an open-source) GIS service to create layers from
your own data. The gallery below shows some simple options still
available on this free version of the platform. Definitely worth playing
around with if your data is fairly common.
