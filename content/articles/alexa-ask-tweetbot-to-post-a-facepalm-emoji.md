I'd like to preface this by pointing out that I do know about the option
to withdraw errant submissions and I later successfully completed the
Alexa Skill certification process with my actual project for the
hackathon. Unfortunately, I made a committment to share my teachable
moments whenever possible.

As part of the [Amazon Alexa Skills Challenge: Life
Hacks](https://alexalifehacks.devpost.com/) on Devpost, I have been
working on Voice User Interface programming for Alexa and for Google
Home. My preference for the latter is strengthening with the relative
ease of pushing Hello World and other dev Skills/Actions, but I am also
extending my AWS knowledge significantly through developing Alexa
Skills. I will dig into that in later posts, but first...the kerfuffle:

I accidentally submitted my first Skill for certification! Not only was
it my first Alexa Skill, but it was also my first Voice User Interface
program. So I submitted my ***Hello World*** for Alexa Skill
certification. When I realized that the launch had automatically
submitted my skill, I was mortified. Live and learn. And then get an
Echo to test these things out on IRL. Eventually.

Again, I know there is an option to withdraw inadvertently submitted
skills, but I was curious to see the response. Now we know. And that's
what mistakes are for!
