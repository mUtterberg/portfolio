"I just need to write one sentence today."

Last night, I went to my first meetup. I'd put 2 other meetups on my
calendar in the weeks prior, but always felt too drained after work to
venture into the unknown. Even though the topics interested me greatly
(one was R, the other was Python) I was intimidated at the thought of
having to explain my place in the data science and web development
landscapes. The only reason I made myself go last night was social
accountability; I'd invited a friend to join me.

The main reasons I invited my friend were 1) to get some social time
with him while still being productive, 2) to hold myself accountable for
going to this Meetup, and 3) because he is new to coding/programming. I
was exhausted after work as usual, but the evening ended up being a
really valuable experience for me. The focus of [Alex
Standiford](http://www.alexstandiford.com)'s talk was productivity,
motivation, dedication, time management, and various resources related
to balancing independent learning with full-time employment. My friend
and I talked direction in tech and I got to weigh in on the value of the
various languages he could pursue. He got to ask questions about PHP and
get some reassurance that the front-end coursework he is taking on Udemy
is still relevant to job opportunities that would interest him.

I emailed him the following notes/links this morning:

The concept of starting with small goals like "I will do one pushup" to
trick your brain into building healthy habits was not new to me. I've
been using the Fabulous app to give my morning, afternoon, and evening
routines some structure and clarity; the "one pushup" mentality is
promoted explicitly in that app. Coopting that strategy for professional
development pursuits was an "aha" moment for me. I had no trouble making
time for online learning in the beginning, but as the school year slowly
demands more of my time - anyone with classroom teaching experience can
relate to the amount of work done off-the-clock - I was finding myself
prioritizing low-entry-point tasks rather than committing to a 20-minute
Python tutorial on various Machine Learning models. But I can commit to
5 minutes of a 20-minute tutorial, one sentence of a blog post, or a
one-paragraph comment on a discussion post in my graduate coursework.

The beauty of committing to one sentence is that you never know when
that activation energy will open the door to full-blown productivity.
