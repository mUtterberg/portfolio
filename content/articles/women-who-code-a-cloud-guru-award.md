As a career changer from the female-dominated education profession to
the male-dominated tech sector, I was initially apprehensive about
gender perceptions and finding a sense of community in tech. Several
women shared their experiences with frequently being talked down to and
other socially upsetting work environments, which in their cases were
gender-motivated though that is not always the case. It is also jarring
to abruptly find myself in situations where I'm one of the only women in
the room, if not *the* only woman at an event. This is not inherently
bad, but it can significantly impact the dynamic or direction of a
project.<!--more-->

Participating in female-oriented tech events has helped me build a sense
of community around navigating issues we face as underrepresented
demographics. It has also directed me to invaluable resources in my own
development as a programmer. For example, I recently received the
following email:

> "Congratulations! [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/) has
> chosen you to receive a free year of full-access membership to [A
> Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru).  We value your membership, and
> appreciate the leadership that empowers this generation of engineers
> with the skills to advance their careers."

I had applied for the scholarship under no pretense that I'd be one of
the women selected. This news led to an increased focus on cloud
development platforms in general, which I believe to be one of the
factors that now sets me apart as a programmer. The tutorials available
are varied, practical, and engaging. Since I am studying for the Data
Engineering on Google Cloud Platform through a Google-produced series of
courses, my interests in the A Cloud Guru (ACG) offerings have been
mostly Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure courses. They offer
a range for each platform that encompasses complete beginners and builds
through advanced specialization certification preparation coursework,
each with targeted tips to help those that plan to take the
Amazon/Google/Microsoft exams.

While the registration fees for these exams are not in my budget at my
current salary, I feel that the direction and instruction these courses
offer has been more than worth the time I am investing in them. Thank
you, A Cloud Guru, for the excellent site and thank you, Women Who Code,
for directing me to this scholarship opportunity!
