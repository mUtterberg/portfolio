Well...today I learned a valuable lesson.

Today I learned that Kaggle Kernels may spend eternity as versions in
process if I try to run them on the wifi at work. We had back-to-back
after school meetings until 6pm in two locations today, so I brought my
computer in the hopes of catching some coding time between meetings. I
found the time, but wasn't able to commit and run my code on district
wifi - even with staff permissions. Woe is me.

I also learned that the code is not necessarily lost! To my delight, I
found my code waiting patiently for me when I got home and reloaded my
browser. Not that it would've been earth-shattering if I'd had to
rewrite a few lines of starter code, but it was a pleasant surprise.

As far as the actual project is concerned, it was another pleasant and
simple problem to take a familiar language and implement it in BigQuery.
Adding arguments to my COUNT() function was a mistake that I did not
catch until the final version, but overall it was a nice little SQL
task. Kaggle, you've done it again.
