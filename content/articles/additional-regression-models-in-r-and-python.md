Support Vector Regression (SVR)
===============================

#### In Python:

#### In R:

.size-full .wp-image-424 width="458" height="468"} Code for SVR in R is
much more succinct than for this model in Python.\[/caption\]

Decision Tree Regression
========================

#### In Python:

.size-full .wp-image-425 width="417" height="278"} Decision Tree
Regression initially visualized as sloped segments, but increasing the
resolution showed the desired stepped function
visualization.\[/caption\]

#### In R:

.size-full .wp-image-426 width="458" height="468"} As in the Python
tutorial for SVR, Decision Tree Regression initially visualized as a
single horizontal average, but adding a command to forcibly increase the
number of steps gave a more accurate tree. Similarly to the initial
sloped segments issue for this model in Python, increasing ggplot
resolution showed the desired stepped function
visualization.\[/caption\]

Random Forest Regression:
=========================

#### In R:

\[gallery ids="480,481,482" type="slideshow"\]
