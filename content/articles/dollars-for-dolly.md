I know it sounds silly, but I used fully hosted WordPress.com for
blogging long before I got into web development, so I didn't see a need
to learn PHP and navigate web hosting when I could just run WordPress
sites on their hosting platform for free. The deeper I got into web
development, however, the more I ran into barriers to customization and
capability. This makes sense, since such a quality platform would not be
sustainable as a business model without paid service tiers.

Confession: this portfolio website is still hosted on WordPress.com and
will remain so until the end of the school year. The convenience factor
outweighs the relatively small upfront fee to transfer my previous WP
experience to a usable working portfolio. However, now that I am
well-versed in coding and cloud-hosting, I plan to tackle the supposed
headache of migrating this site off of WordPress hosting and maintain it
on my own. Because as a Cloud-Happy Web Developer, it just feels wrong
to be partaking of a service that wants me to upgrade to a business
account for something so simple as Hello Dolly. Especially when it comes
auto-loaded on the software itself.

Give me whimsy or give me...not death, but...um...how
about...self-hosting!
