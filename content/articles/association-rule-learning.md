Apriori

Apriori is the more complex of the Association Rule algorithms. This is
because it is designed to take suggested associations and quantify the
strength of each. Beyond business applications, education and service
providers can use this algorithm to refine correlations for testing in a
more inclusive way.

Eclat
=====

While Eclat is simpler than Apriori, it is useful for exploring possible
associations when you don't know where to start looking. This seems
useful to me beyond business by offering teachers, developers, and
others without explicit business focus a way to streamline the
association exploration process. In education specifically, it could
help support administrators and policy makers as they consider factors
beyond teacher rating as impacting student assessment data.

### A note on Python in this context:

This is the first time that Python has been less capable than R in
modeling/evaluating data since I began learning it. As a lifelong
learner, I will continue my study of Python to enrich my Data
Engineering radius. However, this may be some of the reason my
university employed R rather than Python for data analysis.
