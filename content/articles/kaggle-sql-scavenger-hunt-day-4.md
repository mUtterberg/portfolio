Nearly an entire week after the Day 4 task was released in Kaggle's SQL
Scavenger Hunt, I finally made time to sit down and bang out a solution.
Work has been taking up most of my free time because the end of Marking
Period 3 is in 2-3 weeks, so I'm putting in a lot of effort to
recovering (and grading) missing work from my students with Ds and Fs.
Also, I've got two posts in the pipeline about the hackathon I did over
the weekend and the sysadmin progress I made, but haven't taken time to
solidify my written reflections on.

Nevertheless, [I have a solution to the Day 4
task](https://www.kaggle.com/mutterberg/sql-scavenger-hunt-day-4) and
enough energy left before bed to throw these screen grabs and comments
online. There were a few minor issues with misattributed (or
misrequested) dates and unexpectedly large query sizes, but the fixes
were quick and simple. Overall, another great review task from Kaggle.
