One of the positions I applied for when pursuing a career transition
from classroom teacher to Data Scientist gave me this school data
assignment. It was open-ended, with the scenario being a general request
from a school principal for data analysis to help find meaning in the
given data. These data were the previous year's summative assessment
results in ELA and Math, as well as the first two quarters of the
current year's diagnostic assessments in ELA and Math. The data included
levels for each that corresponded between tests, so this was the
variable on which I chose to focus. Also included were raw scores and
percentiles, however these would not have been useful in this analysis.

The assignment also included a request for subgroups within the data.
Student information that was given included "SPED," "Non-SPED,"
"Gifted," "Non-Gifted," and grade levels from 3rd through 8th grades.
After an initial overview of schoolwide trends, I looked at overall and
grade-level trends in the Non-SPED, Non-Gifted subgroup. Due to sample
sizes, I chose to only include overall trends for the SPED subgroup and
included comments rather than percentages and visualizations for the
Gifted subgroup.

On the whole, I was satisfied with my analysis. The timeframe for
completion was relatively brief and the available data did not allow for
meaningful analysis of additional subgroups.
