It's the middle of a 5-day workweek. Well, for me it is. For my
students, today was Friday. They have a 4-day weekend because of a
district-wide professional development day on Friday and Columbus Day
(aka Indigenous Peoples' Day) on Monday. Students were a little wild
this week, especially with Valentine's Day festivities, which added to
the chaos in my schedule by shifting the life part of work-life balance
to a little extra weekday life. The workload will not lighten to
accommodate my priorities, so there will be a little extra work on
Sunday and Monday. Thankfully, Monday is still part of this week's
recovery time. Though it's only a 3-day weekend for us teachers, the
timing of it works out well for me - Case Western Reserve University's
hackathon runs Friday night through Sunday afternoon. More on that next
week. For now, I bring it up to allay my anxiety that these posts are
too brief. My work/life schedule is PACKED right now, so quick scavenger
hunt tasks are welcome breaks to the plan/grade/brainstorm/code cycle of
most every other waking moment.

The content of Day 3 was sorting and basic date/time functions on a US
Traffic Fatality dataset from 2015-2016. On previous days, I'd started
kernels directly from the datasets and coded the activities more or less
from scratch. Today, I chose to fork the tutorial kernel to play around
with that format. [My Kaggle Kernel on the
task](https://www.kaggle.com/mutterberg/sql-scavenger-hunt-day-3/notebook) looks
a little wonky because I left in all of the original markdown boxes,
which included a few essential lines of my code (such as libraries I'd
imported) scattered throughout. I'm not entirely sold on the
notebook-type kernels, but that's mostly based on my preference for
seeing code condensed on the left with minimal padding and the console
placed below or to the right. Old habits die hard. I'm going to stick
with the notebooks for a while and get myself to a place where I'm
beyond comfortable working in them.
