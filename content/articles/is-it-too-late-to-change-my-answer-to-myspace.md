As social engagement shifted to the more accelerated, one-size-fits-all
engagement of the Facebook model, I was part of the cultural shift away
from the less scrollable content network of MySpace. In hindsight, there
are a few reasons I wish I could take it back and stick with MySpace
until the end.<!--more-->

1.  I use my Facebook account so little that I'm waffling between
    deleting it or making a concerted effort to log in every week so
    that message senders don't feel neglected. The trade off is missing
    out on exposure to a sometimes overwhelming variety of events and
    information, but I actually feel more balanced now that I'm back to
    getting my information a little more slowly, organically, and with
    fewer click-baity headlines. So in the long run, I've not found
    lasting value from the Facebook platform itself. Others have, I
    know, but it was attached to a certain level of FOMO that has
    dissipated in my life. I'm not sure that I'd use MySpace more these
    days if it were still widely used, but one indicator to the positive
    may be that I update my blog significantly more frequently than I
    check my Facebook.
2.  The pervasive and invasive goals of Facebook as an organization
    creep me out a bit. I say this as an advocate for Open Data:
    Facebook is in the business of finding ethical boundaries in Data
    Science by crossing them. The "ask forgiveness, not permission"
    attitude upsets me in a Spiderman kind of way. With great social
    power comes great social responsibility, but the goals and methods
    at Facebook often exist in implicit disrespect for civic
    responsibilities. Running experiments on users (well beyond A/B
    testing) without consulting appropriate research authorities like
    the IRB that could have advised them on ethics...poor form, and
    gives legitimate fuel to public distrust of other technological or
    research endeavors.
3.  I feel like Facebook kills creativity, to a certain extent. In their
    own experiments on users, they found that they could manipulate
    emotions based on what news/ads they showed. Content can still be
    creative, but the level of user control in customation is laughable
    compared to MySpace. Facebook chose branding & corporate control of
    user experience over user design flexibility. And they won. Myspace
    died. LiveJournal, Tumblr, all those iterations of social
    networking...not really a thing anymore. I am probably missing
    something, but Iâ€™m frustrated with the hyper-corporate brand
    curation of social nowadays. It feels inorganic. Blogging is kind of
    an outlet for creativity-beyond-content, but the barrier to entry or
    to engagement is much higher than on social networks. That shared
    experience comes up in so many stories of how people my age got into
    computer science, software development, and many in-demand careers
    that rely on coding.

These are my rough thoughts on how MySpace and other hands-on platforms
encouraged coding + creativity to intersect so naturally. Maybe MySpace
would have taken the same corporate/predatory/click-baity turn as
Facebook if it had won; maybe Facebook is just a case of humanity
getting what it wants. A tech boom "be careful what you wish for." I
feel lucky to have grown up in the Lemmings, Oregon Trail, Mavis Beacon
2.0, AIM, MySpace slice of history and I crave a rebirth of tech for
all, not just top-down obsession with market-driven user experience
enhancement that hand-feeds distraction to an increasingly distracted
generation.
