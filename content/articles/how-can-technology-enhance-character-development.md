I have an open question that's been rattling around in my brain: in what
ways can technology enhance the human species regarding character
development? Organisms, cultures, and subgroups with "invasive species"
characteristics seem to win at evolution/imperialism/economics, but
devastate the local ecosystems that they consume in their expansion. In
order to prevent self-destruction, it may be useful for us to consider
how we can continue to grow as a species without exhausting the types of
resources that we now recognize as finite and non-renewable.
