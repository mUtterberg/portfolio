My free-time studies and blog posts have take a backseat in the past
week due to my recent acceptance as a finalist in the Civic Tech Pitch
Competition at Data Days CLE 2018. One finalist will be awarded \$5000
to develop their project, so I have been working on theÂ [slide deck for
my Civic Tech
Pitch](https://utterbergdatadev.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/pitch.pdf "Pitch"),
a biometric student attendance system. I am honored to have advanced to
the finalist stage and excited that I even get a chance to pitch my
project! But I also believe in the value of an automated attendance
system to improve student safety, especially in light of [the abduction,
rape, and murder of a local student in
2017](http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/03/schools_must_call_parents_if_kids_are_absent_says_bill_after_alianna_defreeze_murder.html).
