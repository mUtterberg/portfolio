As a full-time math teacher at a public school in an urban environment
(in which my classes are overcrowded and my students are new English
speakers) I am often tired. I was tired before my graduate coursework
started back up in January. I was tired before I discovered my passion
and affinity for data in December. Yet the additional effort of graduate
classes in Educational Research and personally pushing the pace in Data
Science/Engineering coursework online seems more energizing than
draining.

What exhausts me about classroom teaching is the high-alert emotional
effort involved in classroom management and character development during
classroom learning activities. Grading low-level assignments or cold
multiple-choice quizzes does not overwhelm me, but giving feedback on
more organic and distressingly incorrect open-response assignments
spikes my blood pressure. It leads me down slippery slopes of "I'm a
terrible teacher" or "These kids are struggling too much for one
teacher" lines of thought, though I know there is so much more time for
them to learn after their high school experience. Keeping up hope in the
urban environment can be a challenge, though. I truly believe that youth
development is one of the most important careers in a society and I
really wish I had the personality to thrive in classroom teaching, but
I've made peace with my personal needs in a work environment. My
education policy motto has always been "idealism is not a sustainable
retention strategy" and I finally hit a point where I accepted that I
just don't like teaching in the current extreme-as-the-norm status quo.
As a hyper-analytic ambivert, my brain has been craving remote/flexible
work in a technical field.

As I strengthen the technical skills that I will need as a Data Engineer
or Data Scientist, there are a few key things helping me to stay
balanced and focused.

1.  My wonderful boyfriend, the Network Engineer, has been a huge
    influence on my focus during this current period of career
    transition. I feel secure in our relationship, so my work time is
    exponentially more productive and focused. He works from home and
    often pulls long/late hours for client crisis management or
    after-hours changes, but this makes us value the down time that
    doesn't get interrupted. I'd never taken a real vacation before I
    met him, but he showed me how to unplug. So rather than working at a
    slow burn around the clock, I now aim to finish all my work during
    specific time frames so that I can maintain the routines that give
    my off-time structure. In reality, it is accountability and a
    renewed dedication to off-time routines that keeps me balanced
    healthy in so many ways. I balance his private-sector mentality by
    voicing empathetic perspectives where his preconceptions are not
    well-rounded; he balances my weaknesses by supporting self-care
    perspectives in the context of career.
2.  It's a cold, wet/snowy winter in Ohio. Unlike the beginning and end
    of each school year, I've got fewer outdoor activities trying to
    pull me away from the desk at my home office window. In the summer,
    I am pretty productive because there are no constraints on my time
    to work around. Setting my own hours is ideal, but incompatible with
    classroom teaching. So early fall and late spring tend to be brutal
    or unproductive; either I give in with reckless abandon and take
    full advantage of the beautiful weather or I change my sleeping
    habits to accommodate my work schedule, graduate school, and the
    most irresistable of the season's offerings - at the expense of
    short-term balance. The necessarily rigid schedule is one of the
    variables I aim to address in seeking remote employment, but winter
    temperatures (and poor ski conditions in Ohio) make it particularly
    easy to make substantial progress toward marketable Data
    Engineering/Science skills.
3.  I keep clipboards on hooks around my home office with syllabi and
    checklists. This helps me to balance my weekly and long-term
    graduate coursework assignments with my self-paced independent
    learning on Udemy, Khan Academy, DataCamp, Codecademy, and Kaggle.
    Not every technological advance is accessible in my current
    environment, so this is one area in which it's not practical for me
    to be paperless. I managed assignments on RealtimeBoard for a while,
    but my free upgrade trial ran out and my physical clipboard army
    proliferated. Add to this my large bulletin board, moderate physical
    whiteboard, and 3 remaining free RealtimeBoards - I've made plenty
    of space for myself to visualize and organize professional
    development project tasks. It's a wonderful feeling to know exactly
    where to pick up a project in those 20 minutes you didn't expect to
    have.
4.  Podcasts, specifically TBTL (Too Beautiful to Live), and the Super
    Data Science podcast, and the Learn to Code with Me podcast. These
    have provided a sense of companionship and professional stimulation
    through the long, solitary hours in my home office this winter. TBTL
    has been my companion since 2009 and is not a technical podcast, but
    I look forward to it in the same way that I look forward to time
    with friends. The other two listed are technical podcasts that are
    relatable and applicable to my interests. The hosts are balanced and
    ask insightful questions to a range of quality guests. I recommend
    the Super Data Science podcast by Kirill Eremenko to anyone
    interested in Data, whether in the space of practice/application or
    more general theory/comprehension. The Learn to Code with Me podcast
    is great for anyone new to tech careers in general. The hostess,
    Lawrence Bradford, interviews people in a variety of technology
    careers - from data science to software and web development. This
    happened to align quite nicely with my own varied interests!
5.  Various health & fitness apps. I've been using MyFitnessPal for
    years, currently up to a 757 day streak. This is partly due to the
    acknowledgement every 5 days of streaks in progress, but mostly due
    to the community that comments on many of these updates. I also
    began wearing an Apple Watch2 in 2016, which I am not entirely
    enthusiastic about because I don't truly need a wearable technology.
    However, the goals and stand notifications have increased my
    awareness of prolonged chair time during desk sessions. My new
    mobile influencer is the Fabulous app, developed out of research on
    habit-building at Duke University. At first, I was annoyed at the
    format of the goals and notifications. Once I got my customizations
    and appropriate goals dialed in, however, I find myself meeting
    goals like morning AND afternoon exercise in attainable chunks,
    flossing twice daily, and rewarding myself for progress on healthy
    habits. It's been a very positive experience.
6.  RescueTime. The free version of this product was a game-changer for
    my screen-time productivity. My urge to follow distracted impulses
    has decreased DRAMATICALLY since installing RescueTime.

And yes, I'm still making time for my emergent skateboarding habit.
