One of the highlights of getting involved in the Python community has
been the enthusiasm and sheer joy in the room at gatherings. While I was
looking forward to PyOhio, a free conference held in Columbus last week,
I did not know what to expect. Would the talks be over my head? How
crowded or empty would this small, local conference be?

Of course, it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. Though
the 2 hour drive pushed my boundaries (my world has grown smaller as
I've moved eastward and I primarily travel by bike these days), the time
flew by because I carpooled with fellow Cleveland PyLadies members and
chatted about Data Science, Machine Learning, Natural Language
Processing, and life in general with two wonderful women.

Everyone at the conference itself was welcoming and enthusiastic to
connect. We ended up going to lunch with former strangers each day and
never needed to worry about the conversation feeling forced; there was
so much to discuss from the talks and from our life experiences in such
a short time that conversation flowed easily. I got so carried away with
socializing, the "hallway track," and taking personal time in the Quiet
Room that I missed a few talks I'd been looking forward to. Fortunately,
that wasn't even slightly problematic!

Each talk was recorded and made available on the PyOhio YouTube channel.
They've even organized talks into separate playlists for each year of
the conference! From [the 2018
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2k6bbM_wgjvY02EFUMhwHRyaSaEokT2B),
I highly recommend the following:

-   Natural Language Processing in Python
-   Now is Better than Never: What the Zen of Python Can Teach Us About
    Data Ethics
-   A Son, a Father, and a Computer - How I'm Using Tech to Ease the
    Suffering of my Dying Father

There were several others that were inspiring, informative, and
engaging, but I made myself choose my top 3 to keep from listing half of
the 41 talks available as of this publication. For a list of all topics
from this year, check out [the full 2018 schedule from PyOhio's
