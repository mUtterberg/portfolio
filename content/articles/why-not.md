Slug: why-not
Status: published

After a 3-day weekend that was more intensely focused on AWS, Linux,
Machine Learning models, Python, & my grad school coursework than actual
rest...why wouldn't I spend my first 4:30 - 7 am morning prep routine
grading quizzes, listening to Apriori model lectures, starting a free
trial of Google Cloud Platform, & impulse-deploying a Hello World web
app on Google Cloud Platform?

This may turn out to be a very long 4-day week, but only because I
finally know what I want to do for a living.
