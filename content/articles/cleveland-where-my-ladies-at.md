It has been bugging me lately that there are no active women in tech
groups near me. Girls Who Code seems to have a presence here, but the
local chapter of Women Who Code has had no activity in almost a year.
The closest consistently active group is Akron Women in Tech, which is
usually a manageable drive but not convenient on a weeknight. I
appreciate that community, but I've been craving something closer to
home. So in March, I started a series of organizer
applications.<!--more-->

Tech Ladies
-----------

They've been a reliable source of job postings, support, and
professional development resources via their email blasts and have a
straightforward City Organizer application process. The expectation from
them is that I organize a Tech Ladies event once every quarter. There
was a hiccup this quarter due to my school schedule and miscommunication
with HQ, but we will have our first event this summer. I'd like to see
that group get to the point where I can have a "Coding and Self-Care"
event in Ohio City. The venue I have in mind is cost-prohibitive for
now, but it's on my list.

DjangoGirls
-----------

I met some wonderful ladies irl at PyCon that I'd seen all over the
local tech slack workspace. They were just as enthusiastic as I was
about getting some movement in the local tech diversity scene. We are
still in the early stages of planning, but I will soon be excited to
announce details on the DjangoGirls event we are putting together for
the fall.

PyLadies
--------

The other item I've been working on in my spare time is connecting with
the organizers at PyLadies to get what I need to start a Cleveland
chapter of PyLadies. We hosted the conference in 2018 and will do so
again in 2019, but we don't have a local chapter of PyLadies? No deal.
Yesterday (my birthday) I finally got the email I needed! Our website is
not yet up & running, but we have an email account, our [Meetup
group](https://www.meetup.com/CLE-PyLadies/) is active, and I've already
opened and promptly locked our @CLEPyLadies twitter account by putting
yesterday as the birth date. Turns out they don't consider zero days old
to comply with their minimum user age policy. Whoops!
