I'll reflect on this weekend's hackathon soon, but right now I'm too
amused by this morning's development that I have to share it first. Not
only did I finally figure out that "PrtScn" is much more user-friendly
in Lubuntu than in Windows, but I finally played around with the
development capabilities of Lubuntu. Python 2 and Python 3 are
pre-installed, so all I needed to do was install a text editor and I was
in business! Although once I typed that sentence, I did realize that
there was probably already a text editor pre-installed.

Of course, there is a pre-installed text editor. Why wouldn't there
be??? I mean...an OS with Python 2 and Python 3 pre-installed wouldn't
skip such a basic utility. In demo mode, I lose all configurations and
installs with each shutdown. So while Leafpad may not be as pretty,
it'll do the trick until I install Lubuntu for keeps.

It looks like I may finally commit to a permanent install of Lubuntu
16.04.3 i386 on my clunky old 32-bit desktop PC. Maybe even this
afternoon! But first, I want to figure out how to get those screen shots
to save my monitors to separate files or something.
