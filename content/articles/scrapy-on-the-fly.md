At the most recent Cleveland PyLadies meetup, I vowed to learn about web
scraping for data science. Though web scraping can be a controversial
subject because of the potential for privacy invasion, intellectual
property infringement, or other nefarious activities, I do feel that
there are use-cases that harm none and can help many.

The documentation for Scrapy has a great tutorial, but I enjoyed hearing
Michael Galarnyk talk through anÂ example on [the tutorial he
wrote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=O_j3OTXw2_E). I
found his video through [an article he
wrote](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-scrapy-to-build-your-own-dataset-64ea2d7d4673)
on Towards Data Science.

All in all, this brief introduction to Scrapy took me about half an
hour. If I had realized the barrier to entry was this low, I may have
started down this path much earlier! As it is, I am glad to have a new
avenue for finding interesting data sets. It's not clean data right out
of the gate, but being able to organize so much unstructured data into a
csv is a great start!
