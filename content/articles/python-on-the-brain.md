Waxing Poetic about Python
==========================

Python and R are the main data analysis tools I've used and the
languages in which I learned Machine Learning. Many people have their
favorite, but I'm still parsing out what contexts I prefer for each.
However, I love software/app development so I tend to lean toward Python
as a default.

One reason for this is that the R package to support Convolutional
Neural Networks is still in development. Another simpler reason is that
Python3 is an enjoyable back-end programming language, while R is more
explicitly applicable to in-house data analysis.

For example, I recently ran across Brainpipe, which is a python
neuroscience data mining package that evolved out of PhD candidate
Etienne Combrison's research at University of Montreal. [Brainpipe is a
python toolbox dedicated to the analysis and classification of
neuro-physiological
signals.](https://etiennecmb.github.io/brainpipe/) And with powerful
deep learning packages, it seems clear that Python is at the forefront
of developments in data science. But when I was first learning Python, I
also made a simple Battleship game.

Whimsy on Whimsy
================

The following meme, shared by Andrew Paul Acosta, popped up on my
LinkedIn feed a few days ago:

Definitely a solid chuckle, or even a full-on guffaw. But the absence of
Python surprised me! Where would Python fit on this whimsical continuum?
I love analogies, so I gave it a go:

.size-full .wp-image-1224 width="2000" height="1331"}

I felt the analogy worked well because we often think of R and Python as
nearly level players, whereas Excel/SAS/SPSS are clearly stagnating as
legacy platforms when it comes to the direction data science is
trending.

Regardless, my enthusiasm for Python grows with every new context and
analogy. I will continue to use R when it seems the best tool for a
problem, but Python is outright enjoyable.
