Well...I finally made my first pull request to a public repo on GitHub.
Fixing a typo in documentation isn't exactly coding, but it's still a
contribution! Hopefully I will progress to intentionality in open
source, but happening upon typos to correct is what I have time for
until the school year ends. Baby steps.
