My position as a high school math teacher reinforced in me the
importance of breaking down language into smaller units with power to
convey meaning. Though I am still pretty verbose, working with
immigrants and refugees (and trying to teach them Algebra) made me more
conscious of the words that I chose when explaining concepts or giving
instructions.

As a mathematician and grammar geek, I want to insist on the importance
of proper syntax and maintain that it is integral to conveying meaning,
but the truth is more nuanced than that. Syntax and context *can* change
the meaning of the words that we use, but that is why the terminology is
"sentiment analysis" not "sentiment decree" - there is a margin of error
to assigning sentiment based on collections of key words. However, there
is still much to learn from reducing sentences down to their most
meaningful items.

A common practice in sentiment analysis is to reduce responses down to
the stopwords level, which removes articles and other words deemed to be
non-essential. This reduction allows a computer algorithm to more neatly
discover relationships between words (as features) and sentiments (as a
dependent variable).
