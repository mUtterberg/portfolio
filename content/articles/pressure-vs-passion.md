This portfolio site serves as a landing page for parties that may be
interested in professional services I can offer, but also as
documentation of my passion projects. As such, I enjoy adding content as
projects are completed in real time. However, as a full-time teacher,
part-time graduate student, and entrepreneur/job-seeker trying to
maintain work-life balance, the pressure to meet deadlines and still
contribute to my passion projects strains my time management skills at
times.

I have recently begun allowing myself to push out more posts and
products before they are perfect. This has been a huge relief. Not only
am I able to make more progress on my passion projects because tackling
a portion of a project every morning before work is much more manageable
than putting it off until I have time for a longer session, but I also
have time to reflect on the process in between these sessions.

Some tasks still require my full attention for several uninterrupted
hours (I'm looking at *you*, Linux) but there is always another item on
my list that can be chunked to fit in the occassional 20 minutes to
spare after completing my morning routine. Worst case scenario: I might
get so sucked into it that I leave for work a few minutes later than
intended. But since I already get to work half an hour earlier than
required, even this has minimal risk of negative outcomes. So I look
forward to those little moments of Me Time that the morning often gifts
to me. Besides, I need something to justify that extra mug of coffee!
