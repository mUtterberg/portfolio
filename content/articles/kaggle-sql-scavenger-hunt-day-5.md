Cue the final countdown! I finally made time to bang out [a solution to
the last task of last week's SQL Scavenger
Hunt](https://www.kaggle.com/mutterberg/sql-scavenger-hunt-day-5) on
Kaggle. The more I learn about Data Science, the more I value NoSQL
databases. However, I do feel that SQL is still a valuable skill. This
accidentally experience has been a helpful review of SQL and a very
handy introduction to Kaggle Kernels and using the community for help in
debugging my code, especially since I am new to BigQuery.

Thank you again, Kaggle. Rachel Tatman put together a nice set of tasks
on an interesting variety of datasets!
