I recently turned in my last assignment of graduate school and finally
found myself with time to get back to projects and tinkering. My
boyfriend gave me an ASUS netbook a while back. His best guess is that
it's somewhere between 10 and 15 years old, so he isn't going to be
upset if I completely destroy it in my tinkering. After looking into a
number of ways to repurpose functional netbooks and other obsolete
devices, I decided the weight, small size, and 32-bit processor of this
particular netbook made it a prime candidate for guilt-free
deconstruction.

My initial idea for a project that could utilize parts from this
deconstructions was a "magic mirror" - setting the screen behind one-way
glass and programming a microcontroller to display dynamic content.
Which reminded me that I hadn't had time to turn on and configure my
Rasperry Pi! Two major project moves in one day? Heaven.

The main reason it had taken me so long to get started with the
Raspberry Pi was that I hadn't wanted to experiment with my boyfriend's
wireless mouse & keyboard, since I didn't have a wired keyboard.
However, this was the push I needed to do a quick search and find that,
indeed, that would not be an issue. I plugged in the dongle and fired up
the pi.

My first impressions were largely positive: configuration has gotten
comically simple, the pre-loaded software all seems to be useful (even
the games), and it really does feel like the fully functional computer
center I'd always heard it was. Due to recent developments in my job
prospects, I have not been able to make progress on this specific
project yet. But the tinkering possibilities really do feel limitless
and I'm hopeful about working up to tinkering together some hardware
that can help people. Bring on the unknown future!
