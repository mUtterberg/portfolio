The [COMAP Mathematical Contest in Modeling
(MCM)](http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/) is an annual
undergraduate modeling competition started in 1999 by the COMAP
organization. Enthusiastic to apply what I was learning as an
undergraduate math major, I participate in this competition every spring
from 2006 through 2009.

Starting in 2009, MCM began posting a commentary document from the
judges. Reading through their feedback on trends in participant papers
provided insight into common strengths and weaknesses of student
approaches to a given problem in a given year. I found this to be quite
insightful, looking back.
