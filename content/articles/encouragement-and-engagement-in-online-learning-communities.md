After sending off connect requests to the two instructors of the Machine
Learning A-Z course, Hadelin de Ponteves was the first to accept.
Shortly after reading this notification, another notification appeared.
He had endorsed me for 4 skills: Data Analysis, Python, R, and SQL! The
other instructor, Kirill Eremenko, accepted my connect request soon
thereafter. He sent a direct message thanking me for connecting,
promoting his forthcoming book, and wishing me well in my career.

Upon reflection, I realize that one could be cynical of this level of
engagement in online professional networking because "everyone is
selling something." However, cynicism can be a cold and lonely way to go
through life. It is important to maintain balance between
hyper-engagement in online connections at the expense of in-person
relationships, but I do see value in allowing yourself to be excited
about these little steps we take that deepen our connection to new
worlds. For me, this new world has two possible directions that I may
eventually need to choose between: data science and web development.

Don't laugh, but my *skateboard instructor* (yes, I'm a full-grown woman
that just decided to learn to skateboard) and I were talking about this
last weekend. He mentioned that skate shops can be intimidating for
newbies. My response was that *anything* with its own distinct culture
surrounding it tends to be intimidating for interested learners. We feel
like outsiders, like we don't belong, like asking questions will expose
our ignorance and make us look stupid. We often approach with a
self-deprecating demeanor as a defense against others deprecating us for
our lack of skill. We want others to know we are new so that they will
be gentle in their judgment of us.

For this reason, I will continue to be grateful for open and encouraging
individuals that continue to engage in the online community long after
their own careers are established. Thank you, Hadelin and Kirill, for
the quality instruction and continued contribution to positivity in
professional development.

Note: In addition to books and online courses, Kirill also puts out a
phenomenal Data Science podcast. Check out his website
