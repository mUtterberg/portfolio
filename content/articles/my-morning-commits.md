Balance is a tricky thing to navigate. Documenting my off-time
development is important to me, but I get so into the actual learning
and production in the brief time I have before work that I end up
pushing multiple commits in the 5am-6:30am range at the expense of
personal reflection in public. Aka I have been so enthusiastic about
data and development and so busy with the end of the school year that I
haven't been making time to blog about it.

New Day's Resolution: take time over the weekend to give brief status
updates on the projects that I have in play, even if I can't make time
to fully reflect on each in post form.
