As my background in math and statistics has led me to pursue a career in
Data Engineering, I've found the nitty gritty of cloud computing to be
fascinating - though I wandered into my studies of it quite by accident.
Coursera is my go-to for building structure into my largely
self-designed course flow. Using their "become a Data Engineer" pathway
as a guide, I studied Python programming more in-depth, algorithms and
data structures, data ethics, and cloud computing. This last topic
consists of three main players: Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web
Services, and Microsoft Azure.

Through financial aid on Coursera, I have been studying GCP consistently
on a data engineering-specific pathway and plan to attempt the [Google
Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer
exam](https://cloud.google.com/certification/data-engineer) after my
teaching job ends in May. However, I also received a scholarship for a
one-year membership through Women Who Code to unlimited coursework on [A
Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/), which has significantly more
offerings that pertain to AWS. For the time-being, I am working my way
up through levels of coursework on ACG toward the AWS Certified Big Data
- Specialty course. Time and financial restrictions (GCP's data engineer
exam is \$200 and the two AWS exams that lead to big data certification
sum to \$450) may force me to choose which certification(s) to
ultimately commit to, but for now I am more than happy to take
concurrent coursework on the two platforms.

As a result, I plan to compare these two giants in a series of
comparison posts. Each will have "Cloud Compare" as both a tag and a
title. My goal will be to document my preferences when I have them to
aid in my eventual decision, but I also hope to be able to recommend
these products strategically and appropriately to a wide variety of use
case scenarios for future clients. Feel free to use my observations when
they benefit your product decision needs. And with that, I bring you my
first observation:

Comparative Documentation
-------------------------

I'm not yet sure which platform offers the better value, but both seem
to offer comparable capabilities and services. To that end, Google Cloud
Platform offers a resource that [maps AWS products to their GCP
offerings](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/map-aws-google-cloud-platform).
(They also show how the [Microsoft Azure platform maps to GCP
products](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/map-azure-google-cloud-platform).)
Amazon did not appear to provide such documentation, even when "GCP" and
"Google Cloud Platform" were entered as terms in the AWS search page.
From a business perspective, I could see this as being intentional.
However, as a consumer I prefer transparency. Point: Google.

AWS: 0  GCP: 1
