Let me frontload this by reiterating that I've spent the majority of my
adult years as a high school math teacher. We are not typically the
first content-area you think of when remembering the most design-savvy
of your teachers. My strengths tended to center more on depth of
knowledge and adaptability than on beautiful bulletin boards.

Having said that, I recently set my mind to improving my creative
impulses with some self-guided study of design principles. Generally we
learn things out of necessity or interest. But interest is just
self-generated necessity, right? So I have been learning about design
out of self-generated necessity because I decided I want to have
stickers available for those that will be in attendance at the inaugural
meetup of Cleveland PyLadies. I'm sure the designs will change for the
better before I place a full order, but StickerMule has pretty
reasonable pricing on their simple 10 sticker custom sample runs.

Our event space for the first meetup suggests a capacity of 14-16. To
me, that number naturally meant I'd need to design two different images
for a total of 20 sample stickers. They may be kitschy and a little
jenky, but I'm proud of what I was able to put together on a short
timeline and with limited tooling:

\[gallery ids="1382,1383" type="rectangular"\]

There are a few mistakes I didn't catch until after I'd approved each
proof for production, but it's a good jumping-off point. I'm excited to
encourage other women to take things like this and improve upon them out
of their own experience or enthusiasm. To me, that's one of the main
reasons people engage in professional communities. It's part social
club, part value-add, and part opportunity to stretch your skills or
contribute those you already have. Everyone participates for a different
reason, but it doesn't work unless someone shares their thing. For now,
a bit more graphic design is officially part of my thing!
