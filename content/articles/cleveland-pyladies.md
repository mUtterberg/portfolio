Grind & Design
--------------

Several people have helped me get our new Cleveland chapter of PyLadies
off the ground and no one was anything less than enthusiastically
supportive. However, the early days were somewhat stressfull as I did a
lot of the ground work on my own while working full-time and finishing
up grad school part-time. The most enjoyable aspect was also the most
frustrating because of my technical bent: making design choices. As a
utility player, I'm sure my design skills will soon be eclipsed by the
talented women now joining our group. However, learning design
principles and playing around with the tools has been a ton of fun!
