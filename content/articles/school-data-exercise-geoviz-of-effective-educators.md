Data was presented as aggregated effectiveness rating percentages by
school for the 2013-2014 school year. Title and summary information was
cleaned away and I inserted a blank column for geographical data. Rather
than taking time to research data mining in Google from Excel criteria,
I just copied each school name and pasted them into Google one at a
time, then copied the zip codes into the appropriate cell for each
school. It took some time, but I wanted to have somewhat accurate
geographical data to present for this problem.

I chose these four visualizations to explore the slight differences
between average and median percent aggregation by Tableau. Based on the
gradients available, I am satisfied with the results and am glad I took
the time to include the zip codes.
